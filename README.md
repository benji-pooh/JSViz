## JSViz

JSViz is audio visualizer in Javascript and HTML. It should be compatible with majority of web browsers, and is very small and simple.


### Now, would I be able to use this at like a party for example?

While this **does support** almost every device with a web browser, it may not run correctly on certain devices. This has **only** been tested on chrome. Thats it. So if you are going to use this for something like that, please test it first. 

There is also no queueing system, so you cannot add multiple audio tracks and play it one after the other automatically.
